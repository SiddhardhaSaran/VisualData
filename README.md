# VisualData
Node Editor for Data analysis

Main objective is to use a flowchart like editor for your data analysis. My work involves figuring out the spending patterns of customers and if they are risky, some sort of negative action will be applied on them

We use a lot of simulations (in python, excel, sql etc) for this, but since most of my team is not that well versed in python i thought that a visual tool which can be used to build strategies would be a better user experience.

This is a very simple side project, i havent written code in over 5 years so most of the above is just stitching codes from various libraries, google, stackoverflow and chatgpt.
