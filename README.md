# VisualData
Node Editor for Data analysis

Main objective is to use a flowchart like editor for your data analysis. I figured out that i would greatly benefit from such a tool at my work and figured i can build an easy simple to use GUI. Also since most of my team is not that well versed with python i thought this is something which can help them as well. As we use a lot of simulations using excel, python, sql etc.

This is a very simple side project, I havent written code in over 5 years so most of the above is just stitching codes from various libraries, google and stackoverflow.
